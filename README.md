# My Data Science  Learning Journey
This is my repo to learning-by-doing Data Science.

## My Main Resources
I'm using multiple resources to study and apply what I learn here with examples. This is a list of **main** resources I use (_I will update this list whenever I use a new resource_):

* [Data Science Fundamentals: Learning Basic Concepts, Data Wrangling, and Databases with Python](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/data-science-fundamentals/9780134660141/). Created by Jonathan Dinu.
    * [Course Materials](https://github.com/hopelessoptimism/data-science-fundamentals).
